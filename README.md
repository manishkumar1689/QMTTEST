# EDS - Angular

## __Disclaimer__: The EDS team is not maintaining this repository often, and therefore we don't recommend anyone to use it in production. Please visit [EDS Integrations section](http://eds.internal.ericsson.com/tutorials/integrations) to learn more.

This is a demo of how to use Ericsson Design System components, with the Angular framework.

## Installation

* Run `npm install`

* Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Development

All the components that are going to be published are under the `projects/eds/angular` folder, so edit those files if you want to make changes to any components.

## Build

Run `npm run bundle` to generate your new Angular bundle. You can access this bundle on the `dist/eds/angular` folder. You won't need this step for the development process, but it's good to build it and see that everything is working correctly once changes are made.
